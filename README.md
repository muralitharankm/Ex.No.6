Objective

I designed prompts to guide AI tools in generating Python code, integrating with APIs, comparing outputs, and suggesting actionable insights for project-related tasks.

Procedure / Prompts Used

Generate Python Code:

Prompt: “Write Python code to fetch data from two different APIs and store the results in separate CSV files.”

Compare Outputs:

Prompt: “Compare the two CSV files generated from the APIs and highlight differences in data values or missing entries.”

Generate Insights:

Prompt: “Based on the comparison results, suggest meaningful insights or next steps for data analysis.”

AI-Generated Responses

Python Code Output:

Code for fetching API data, storing in CSV, comparing values, and generating a summary table.

Explanation:

AI provided step-by-step comments in the code explaining API requests, data handling, and comparison logic.

Insights:

Suggested trends, anomalies, and next steps for analysis based on API outputs.

Reflection

The prompts were effective in guiding AI to produce working Python code and meaningful comparisons.

Clear, structured prompts resulted in more accurate outputs than broad or vague prompts.

Could improve by adding specific data formats or constraints to make outputs even more precise.

Result / OUTPUT

The prompts were executed successfully. AI generated the Python code, comparison outputs, and actionable insights as expected.

# Result: The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully.
