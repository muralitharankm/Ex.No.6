# Ex.No.6 Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

# Date:
# Register no: 25011373
# Aim: Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with Multiple AI Tools

#AI Tools Required: ChatGPT

# Explanation:
Experiment the persona pattern as a programmer for any specific applications related with your interesting area. 
Generate the output using more than one AI tool and based on the code generation analyse and discussing that. 

# Conclusion:
Title: Framing Prompts for AI-Assisted Project Coding

Objective

I designed prompts to guide AI tools in generating Python code, integrating with APIs, comparing outputs, and suggesting actionable insights for project-related tasks.

Procedure / Prompts Used

Generate Python Code:

Prompt: “Write Python code to fetch data from two different APIs and store the results in separate CSV files.”

Compare Outputs:

Prompt: “Compare the two CSV files generated from the APIs and highlight differences in data values or missing entries.”

Generate Insights:

Prompt: “Based on the comparison results, suggest meaningful insights or next steps for data analysis.”

AI-Generated Responses

1. Python Code Output:

Code for fetching API data, storing in CSV, and reading both CSVs for comparison.

2. Comparison Example (Simulated Data):

API 1 Output

ID	Name	Value
1	Alpha	100
2	Beta	200
3	Gamma	300

API 2 Output

ID	Name	Value
1	Alpha	100
2	Beta	250
4	Delta	400

Comparison Result:

ID 2 (Beta) has a Value mismatch: 200 vs 250

ID 3 (Gamma) is missing in API 2

ID 4 (Delta) is missing in API 1

3. AI-Generated Insights:

There are inconsistencies between the two APIs that require data validation.

Some records appear only in one API, suggesting incomplete data.

Next steps: reconcile differences, check API data sources, and ensure completeness before analysis.

Reflection

Clear, structured prompts helped generate accurate Python code and correct comparisons.

The comparison table clearly highlights discrepancies between API outputs.

Improvements: Add specific rules for comparison, like ignoring minor formatting differences or adding thresholds for numeric value mismatches.

# Result: The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully.
